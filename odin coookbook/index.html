    <h1 id="header">Hi hello this is recipe number one</h1>
    <p>fried eggs</p>
    <p>to make fried eggs you will need a:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            a frying pan
        </li>
        <li>
            a working stove
        </li>
        <li>
            some oil(or butter if you are fancy but i personally hate the smell)
        
        </li>
        <li>the egg</li>
        <li>and salt and papper to actually taste the egg</li>

    </ul>

            pput the pan on the stove
        </li>
        <li>
            pour oil or put half a block of butter
        </li>
        <li>
            wait a little
        </li>
        <li>
            crack in our egg
        </li>
